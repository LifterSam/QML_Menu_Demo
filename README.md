Hello,

this is a demo of how to generate a simple ordering menu with QML. To test you can download `MenuDemoGitDeploy.rar`.
Inside this compressed file there is the full build of the demo with an executable file called `MenuDemo.exe`.
Click it and have fun ordering stuff that will never be delivered hehe!

The concepts shown in this demo are:

#### Core QML Concepts
• Declarative UI 
• Property Binding 
• Custom Components (MenuSection, MenuItemAndPrice, SpiceDial) 
• Layout Management (ColumnLayout/RowLayout) 
• Anchoring System

#### Qt Quick Controls
• ApplicationWindow 
• Pane 
• SpinBox 
• Slider 
• RadioButton 
• Dial 
• BusyIndicator 
• Button 
• Material Style

#### Advanced Features
• Dynamic Property Aliases 
• Custom Palette Styling 
• Font Loading 
• Image Resources 
• State Management (visible/opacity) 
• Signal Handling (onClicked/onTapped) 
• Timer-Based Animations

#### Architecture
• Component Reusability 
• Readonly Properties 
• Cross-Component Communication 
• Centralized Style Management 
• Responsive Layout Strategies

#### Real-World Patterns
• Order Total Aggregation 
• Form Validation (enabled states) 
• Modal Dialogs 
• Async Operation Simulation 
• Conditional Feedback Messages 
• Input Sanitization (spinbox/slider limits)

Enjoy.
